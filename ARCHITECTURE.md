# Architecture: DAG-First Autonomous Agent

A TypeScript remake of GSD-2 built on pi-sdk (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`), replacing GSD-2's sequential-default execution model with a DAG scheduler that maximizes parallelism at every level. Execution is organized around a feature DAG, with task DAGs local to a feature branch and collaboration with `main` handled through a serialized merge train.

## Core Thesis

GSD-2's execution model defaults to sequential. Parallelism is opt-in via `depends_on` declarations. This remake inverts that: **the DAG is the only execution model**. Features depend only on features. Tasks depend only on tasks within the same feature. Milestones are organizational / progress units that can be queued by the user as an ordered steering list, but they are not dependency nodes. Work progression is tracked through **work control** phases that end at `work_complete`, while branch / merge / conflict coordination is tracked separately through **collaboration control** states. Overall feature `done` is derived only after merge.

## Scenario Specs

High-level test situations live under `specs/test_*.md`. These markdown specs capture feature-branch lifecycle, merge-train, file-lock, replanning, and crash-recovery scenarios before they are converted into executable tests.
